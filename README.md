# nflapi
Retrieve data from nfl.com

## Description
This package provides access to data available at nfl.com.
Some data is retrieved from undocumented API's that I learned
about from [nflgame](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame).
Other data is scraped from the nfl.com website.

## API
See [docs](https://ca3tech.github.io/nflapi/nflapi/)

# Announcement
It would appear that the NFL has discovered this and/or other
projects and the sources I depend on no longer exist. I do not
see a valid replacement for the game data retrieval, which is
the most important part as that data allows for calculating
player statistics, therefore, at least for the time being this
package is defunct.
